This is my portfolio! It is a work in progress, as I will be adding to it as my skills grow over the course of this class. Within the portfolio, you will find a short About Me section, samples of my previous work, and links to the best modes to contact me.

## Installation

In order to install this project, you will need to havev already installed Visual Studio Code (or some other code editing software with HTML and CSS capabilities). From there it is just a matter of cloning the SSH key to your desktop and openning the files in your editing software.

## Credits

This code was made from scratch by me, with references to inclass assignment material provided by the University of Washington continuing education program's full stack part-time course, instructor John Young.
